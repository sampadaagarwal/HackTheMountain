                    Stress is the body's reaction to any change that it experiences, which requires an adjustment or response. The body reacts to these changes with physical, mental, and emotional responses. The word 'stress' is quite often used in a negative sense. But stress isn't always bad and it is a normal part of life. In fact, sometimes stress can be positive and can spur one to be productive, creative, prepared for challenges, and stay motivated and focused.


                    But too much stress or prolonged stress can impact our physical and mental health. It can bring on – or worsen – certain symptoms or diseases. Common side effects of stress on the body range from aches and pains, sleep related issues, nausea and dizziness to anxious or racing thoughts, moodiness, and even irritability and short temper.
                    
                    When does stress become a matter of concern? When it becomes overwhelming and starts affecting your health, your productivity, your relationships, and the overall quality of your life. There are physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms of stress. Being aware of these can help you understand what you are going through and deal with it accordingly.

                    Depression is not simply feeling low or sad. It is a genuine mental health concern that can be triggered by several causes. While sadness can be brief, depression will persist for at least two weeks or more. When depression persists, it may become a serious health condition and hamper an individual’s ability to function in many areas of life, including work and relationships.



Some cases of depression are more severe, with intense symptoms such as significant appetite and weight loss, sleep problems, and frequent thoughts of self-harm or suicide.
